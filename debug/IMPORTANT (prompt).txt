i sent you parts of the code i am working on, the matcher code picks the common matches from different sources and the arb calculator searches for arb opportunities within them. the raw matches are provided by scrapers for each source. i sent you two examples of json files from different sources.
the problem here that in the Live mode when i ran the main code searching for arbitrage opportunities (all while the scrapers of each website are continously scraping) there are some false positives because there is a delay between scrapers. example : for a certain match :
1x odd is 1.48 and away win odd is 2.60 in source A, and for the same matrch in source B 1x odd is 1.5 and away win odd is 2.50, for now there is no arbitrage opportunities, some event happened in the match that affected the odds, and because there is a delay between scrapers, the new source A odds are 1x odd is 2.12 and away win odd is 1.80, but the odds are in the source B are still the same because the scraper of that source is a little bit delayed from the source A scraped even though that the source B already updated their odds due to the match event, in this case a false arbitrage opportunity is detected between these two matches due to the delay between scrapers.
THE SOLUTION : 
- i want to add a new option in the main py : "SHOW_ONLY_CONFIRMED" that can be either true or false
- if false the code will run the same exact way
- if true this will happens : the code won t annouce any arbitrage opportunity until both sources had their json file updated, that means if an opportunity was detected because one source changed their odds, the code must wait until the other source update their odds then confirm the existence of that arbitrage opportunity using the "last_updated" which contain the exact time the json file from its source was exported which the represent when the data was updated. "last_updated" is always found at the top of each json files of all the sources
- for example the code find an arbitrage opportunity between source A and source B at 2025-07-13T04:00:23.901007+01:00 (the opportunity birthtime) due to an odd change that happened within the source A (the code has found that source A is the one with the json file with the latest "last_updated" which means the source B is the one that is delayed, source B has its json file last updated value at : 2025-07-13T04:00:22.903592+01:00), the code won t print the arbitrage opportunity details but will print how many arbitrage opportunities that are waiting to be confirmed. then when the source B scraper update its json file (the last_updated value now became a time that is after the opportunity birth time example 2025-07-13T04:00:25.423427+01:00 which comes after the opportunity birth time : 2025-07-13T04:00:23.901007+01:00) there are two scenarios : scenario 1 : the source B odds changed to values that cannot realize an arbitrage opportunity or the odds disappeared after that update, in this case the detected arbitrage opportunity was a false positive due to the delay between scrapers. scenario 2 : the source B odds don t change or change to values that still realize an arbitrage opportunity, in this case the arbitrage opportunity is confirmed and will be displayed as the original code would displayed it, the activity duration will be added to the arbitrage opportunity json and will be calculated considering the the first birth time of that opportunity as the beginning of the activity duration, in our example the activity duration will be the duration between the now time and the opportunity birth time : 2025-07-13T04:00:23.901007+01:00.
- once an opportunity is confirmed it will be displayed until it disappears as the original code would do
- this logic when activated will applied to both modes live and prematch
- to summlarize this logic will only affect when the code will display the arbitrage opportunities (it will act like a filter that shows the arb opportunity once the delayed source is updated)
- don t change any logic or anything that is not related to my request
