this program scans matches from different sources and match them in matching groups then finds arbitrage opportunities (i did not send the arb calculator code)
make the code also tries to reverse the home and away names and select the combination with the most accuracy (because sometimes some sportsbooks source are wrong about their home/away teams naming)
make it as an option that can be enabled through REVERSE CHECKING (True or False) (activated by --reverse-check). if REVERSE CHECKING is False the code will act the same exact way
if REVERSE CHECKING is True :
we dont compare two reversed match with each other (because in that case it will be the same comparaison we did with the original one) we only compare a reversed version with the original version
in a matching group, if the number of reversed matches exceeds the half of the total matches of that group than the reversed matches are reversed back to their normal state and the normal ones will be reversed, Example : a matching group contain 3 sources matches, two of them are reversed (Source 1 (original) : Barcelona vs Real Madrid, source 2 (was reversed) : Real Madrid vs FC Barcelona, source 3 (was reversed) : Real Madrid vs Barcelone, here for example source 2 and souce 3 are the one that are reversed)  , than the error of home and away team naming is likely due to the source that is not reversed (due to the majority of sources pointing that the home team is actually Real Madrid and the away team is Barcelona), so the program must reverse back the reversed matches to their normal state and reverse the other sources matches that are likely to have their data incorrect
if the code can t detemine by majority which source(s) are incorrect about their naming (50 % vs 50 % of source are different about their naming data) then it will pick a random source as the correct naming reference
after the code determine the correct position of home and team names, if a match gets reversed all the odds names get replaced like this : home becomes away and away becomes home or 'player1' becomes 'player2' and 'player2' becomes 'player1' (these naming swapping rules can be determined in new json file named swap_words.json which will contain expressions that if found in an odd name that needs to be reversed it will get reversed with the opposite expression defined for that word example home and away or 'player1' and 'player2')
dont change anything not related to my request
